# Simple Shell

# Introduction

The Simple Shell project is a lightweight command-line interpreter designed to resemble a Unix shell. It offers users a simplified interface for interacting with the operating system, allowing them to execute various commands to perform tasks and manage processes. The shell is capable of functioning in both interactive mode, enabling direct communication with the user for command execution, and non-interactive mode, which facilitates command execution through files and scripts.

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can input commands to execute various tasks. The shell will process the command and display the corresponding output. You can continue entering additional commands to perform further tasks. The shell will terminate its execution either when the end of the file is reached or when Ctrl-D is pressed, indicating the end of input in interactive mode.

In non-interactive mode, you have the option to write your commands into a file or script. You can then run the shell, providing your file or script as an argument. The shell will execute the commands within the file or script, step by step, without the need for direct user input. This allows for automated execution of commands and the ability to perform batch operations.

In summary, the shell offers both interactive mode for direct command input and non-interactive mode for executing commands from files or scripts, providing flexibility in how tasks are performed.
